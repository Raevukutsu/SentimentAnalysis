Scripts and files for the sentiment analysis of Mark Twain

The Alpha build is here only as something to be gazed at with bemused puzzlement. 
It is a bulky and clumsy thing that was created in an effort of gratifying one’s intellectual vanity. 

The Beta is much better. Still over 300 lines, but it makes more sense. 

The folders guard many data. No really, Excel crashed on me twice while I tried to sort it all and make it neat and nice.

The plots won’t bite you, merely inform you of their emotional disposition towards the use of words. 
Barcharts and jagged lines, of course.

The mountainous curves of sentiments portray the unrelenting cliffs that many fictional characters had to endure, some hang on still.
